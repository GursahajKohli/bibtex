  abstract = {Present day quantum technologies enable computations with tens and soon hundreds of qubits. A major outstanding challenge is to measure and benchmark the complete quantum state, a task that grows exponentially with the system size. Generative models based on restricted Boltzmann machines and recurrent neural networks can be employed to solve this quantum tomography problem in a scalable manner.},
