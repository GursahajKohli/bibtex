# The Vector Institute ``bibtex`` Repository 

The files in this repository determine the list of publications that appear on the Vector Institute website. The website uses the same BiBTeX reference management system that Vector researchers use daily in their own research to produce bibliographies. By hosting these files in a git repository, we maintain a complete history of every change made to these files, including metadata that tells us who made each change. Further, changes to certain files in this repository automatically trigger the website to update itself.

## Structure of the repository

The key files/directories at the root of the repository are:

    all.bib
    flatten.sh
    bibtex/ 
    thumbnails/

* ``all.bib``: The publications on the website are, at any moment, determined by the contents of ``all.bib``. This file is automatically generated and should not be modified directly, as these changes will be overwritten. Indeed, in the future, ``all.bib`` will likely not be stored in the repository at all.

* ``flatten.sh``: This file is a bash shell script that can be executed on any unix-based system which has bib2bib program (part of most bibtex2html packages). Those wishing to understand how the ``.bib`` files are combined should study this script.

* ``bibtex/``: This directory contains BiBTeX database files, organized informally into a hierarchy of subdirectories. BiBTeX database files use a text-based file format to produce  lists of bibliography items, such as articles, books, and theses. *We assume BibTeX database files end with the ``.bib`` suffix.*

* ``thumbnails/``: The directory contains image files in ``jpg`` and ``png`` formats, organized informally into a hierarchy of subdirectories. The files below this directory are made visible on the web at ``http://vectorinstitute.ai/thumbnails``. The BiBTeX database files may make reference to these images in order to add thumbnail images to individual publications.

## Instructions for Vector groups (OUT OF DATE)

Each group (or individual) may maintain its own public git repository containing bibtex. These repositories are then added as submodules in this repository and updated as necessary. Therefore, in order to change/add/remove a bibtex entry,
you need to

1. Make the change in the group's public git repository;
2. Contact the administrator of this repository to fetch and merge those changes.

The current administrator is Daniel Roy <daniel.roy@utoronto.ca>.

## Formatting rules for bibtex

The following guidelines are aimed to improve the quality of the publication page.

### Choosing *key* values

Every entry is given a key. In order to minimize clashes, please use the following formatting

    [author summary][YYYY][acronym of venue][keyword or one-two word summary of title]

The `[author summary]` might be

* `[last name]etal`
* `[ListOfLastNamesInCamelCase]`
* `[INITIALS]`

### Cross references for major conferences

We want our bibtex to be clean and consistent. For this reason, we will use cross referencing when making citations to proceedings, such an NIPS, ICML, CVPR, etc. Every major conference has a `@proceedings` entry in *proceedings.bib*. When making an `@inproceedings` entry, simply add, e.g., `crossref={NIPS2018}`, in order to import all the fields relevant to that year's proceedings. In particular, the `@inproceedings` entry should NOT have the year, booktitle, volume, etc. specified. It should specify the pages, title, authors, etc.

### Standardized `@strings`

The *proceedings.bib* file makes use of `@string`'s to standardize booktitles. In addition, `@string`'s should be used also for the names of journals.

### Links to arXiv

We encourage authors to list arXiv preprint information, even for published articles. Every article that appears also on the arXiv should specify 

    archivePrefix = {arXiv},
    eprint = {nnnn.nnnnn},
    primaryClass = {mm.LL},

where *mm.LL* should be replaced by the primary class, such as *cs.LG* or *cs.AI*.
